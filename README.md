### Allegheny College Statement of Community

Allegheny College also expects students and faculty to act according to its Statement of Community:

> Allegheny students and employees are committed to creating an inclusive, respectful and safe residential learning community 
> that will actively confront and challenge racism, sexism, heterosexism, religious bigotry, and other forms of harassment and 
> discrimination. We encourage individual growth by promoting a free exchange of ideas in a setting that values diversity, trust 
> and equality. So that the right of all to participate in a shared learning experience is upheld, Allegheny affirms its commitment 
> to the principles of freedom of speech and inquiry, while at the same time fostering responsibility and accountability in the 
> exercise of these freedoms. This statement does not replace existing personnel policies and codes of conduct.

### Honor Code

All students and faculty at Allegheny College are bound by the Honor Code. Everyone expects that your behavior reflects this commitment. 
Given the eminently shareable and reproducible nature of code, the Department of Computer Science adds the following statement to the 
general college policy:

> It is recognized that an important part of the learning process in any course, and particularly in computer science, derives from 
> thoughtful discussions with teachers, student assistants, and fellow students. Such dialogue is encouraged. However, it is necessary 
> to distinguish carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others, and the student who 
> produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone elseâ€™s work. It will therefore be understood that all 
> assignments submitted to faculty of the Department of Computer Science are to be the original work of the student submitting the assignment. 
> Appropriate action will be taken when assignments give evidence that they were derived from the work of others.

The above statement, of course, also applies to solutions derived from discussions on Stack Overflow and other similar resources.

#### AI tools

I fully expect that many of you will use tools like OpenAI's GPT code completion, GitHub Co-pilot, and others on assignments. These are 
professional, industry-grade tools. However, there is a marked difference between implementing the solutions these tools suggest and 
copying their suggestions wholesale. In many cases, these tools will lead you to either incorrect or significantly advanced answers. As
one might say in the consumer trade, _caveat emptor_.

One of the goals of your time in this class, much less at Allegheny, is to learn how the subjects discussed in classes relate and impact 
your future work. While there are many ways that your assignments will test your understanding of the concepts underlying our coursework,
I ask a few of things from you, completely aware that you are fully on your own honor with any of these:

* be prepared to explain a detailed understanding of the code you're offering for review, documenting where and how you used an assistant tool in:
  * technical reports
  * code comments, specifically labeling the portions of code derived from use of AI tools
* consider how you might improve an assitant-generated solution, documenting this in reports and implementing your improvements in code
* keep an operating assumption that I'm not reviewing your solutions for a "gotcha"; I only assume the best of your effort

### Classroom ethics

The discipline of computer science, like many others, encourages its members to act according to discipline-specific ethics. I encourage you 
to take time to review the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) [Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/about/acm-code-of-ethics-booklet.pdf).

### Seeking assistance

#### Assistance with course concepts

Students who struggle to understand knowledge and skills defined in this course are encouraged to seek assistance from instructional staff. To meet 
with me, consult my available office hours (above) and make an appointment.

Historically, students who are successful in my courses visit and discuss course concepts with instructors or TLs early and often. See [above for my office hours](#office-hours) 
or go to [this schedule for Technical Leaders' office hours](https://www.cs.allegheny.edu/teaching/technicalleaders/).

#### Assistance outside of the course

If you find yourself in difficult circumstances which affect your ability to participate in or complete course work, let me know immediately. Full stop.

Do not wait until the end of the semester. 

*It is part of my job* to make sure that students receive the assistance they need. Do not hesitate to let me know if there is anything I can do 
with respect to your ability to handle your work. This is especially true of our current circumstances. Again, let me remind you -- __**it is part of my job**__ 
to help you access Allegheny College resources that will enable your safety and success.

In many situations, the following list of resources may help:

* [The Maytum Learning Commons](https://sites.allegheny.edu/learningcommons/)
* [Allegheny College Counseling Center](https://sites.allegheny.edu/learningcommons/)
* [The Winslow Health Center](https://sites.allegheny.edu/healthcenter/)
* [Student Life](https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentlife/)

### Special needs and disability

Students with disabilities who need accommodations in this course are encouraged to contact Disability Services at `+1 814-334-2898`. 
Disability Services is part of the Learning Commons, located in Pelletier Library. Should you need accommodations, contact this office as 
soon as possible to ensure that approved accommodations are communicated and implemented as quickly as possible. This serves both you and me 
in providing the best environment for learning and support.
