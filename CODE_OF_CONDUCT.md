# CMPSC 404: Code of Conduct

This contract is built on the Scrum values:

* Courage
* Commitment
* Focus
* Openness
* Respect

While these seem like universal ideas, _not_ defining them for ourselves in concrete terms spells disaster. The first step to a shared reality is
to _share values_ and not operate using individual, divergent core beliefs and assumptions.

In the opening frame of the course, we will develop the constituent parts of this document together to create a uniform set of expectations that
we can apply to evaluating our work over the course of the semester. Agreements made here will influence evaluation of teamwork and other 
collaborative in/tangibles. While the instructor guides some of the parameters of our shared reality, it's only to limit and focus discussion
on productive definitions.

## Definitions

These definitions are adapted from the official terminology at [scrum.org](https://scrum.org). Terms below guide decisions we make toward establishing
the norms which govern all teams.

### Courage

Team members need courage to do the right thing and face tough problems. For example, they should exhibit courage to explore the unknown, 
to change direction, to share information and to engage in courteous disagreements.

### Commitment

Each team member commits to achieving the team’s goals and to support each other. This involves commitment or dedication to:

* Delivering consistent results; 
* Quality;
* Working toward and within project goals; 

### Focus

Teams should focus on the work of the module and its goals. Examples of this include focusing on: creating value, what’s currently most 
important and getting to Done.

### Respect

It’s necessary for team members to respect each other as skilled, intuitive and creative learners. Team members should respect each other's 
differing expertise, intuitions and perspectives and be respectful when they disagree.

### Openness

The Scrum Team and its stakeholders agree to be open about all of the work and the challenges with performing the work. Scrum Team members 
should be open about the struggles they face. They should share feedback and learn from each other and from their stakeholders.

## Working agreement

We apply the values above to create a working environment that is conducive to progress and project quality. To do so, we define the following
areas and terms as our promoted and celebrated behaviors. In your team's branch, define each of the `TODO`s below making sure to define _at least
three (3)_ items for each category and a maximum of _five (5)_.

These terms both _guide and protect_ your contributions in this course. They will also constitute a _whole course contract_--the instructor will
use contributions from all teams to develop a single contract that holds our entire class to the same contribution standard.

### People and accountability

Steps you will take to hold yourself to a standard for discovering information, achieving goals, and delivering product results for our client.

#### Individual accountability

|Benchmark |Related Value(s) |
|----------|-----------------|
| Be honest with yourself about your skills/capabilities; admit when you're at the limit of your knowledge and seek assitance/resources |`Focus` |
| Make sure your voice and thoughts are heard; default to a personal policy of raising issues soon and often | `Courage` |
| Trust team members to perform their roles and tasks with full ability; unless requested, focus on your role's tasks | `Focus` |
| Default to a position of kindness<sup>†</sup> | `Courage`, `Respect |
| Maintain a clear, coordinated, and transparent schedule determined and enforced by the team, revised where approriate |`Commitment, Focus`           |
| Attend class, lab, and meeting sessions outside of either of these occasions  | `Commitment`, `Focus`, `Respect` |
| Own mistakes, taking accountability for both making and repairing whatever deficiencies result   |`Courage` |
|Seek feedback from peers and superiors for continuous improvement on a regular, potentially scheduled, basis. | `Commitment` |

<sup>`†`</sup>_Kindness_ is not a subset of _niceness_. See this discussion of "kindness" from the [Ohio State Univeristy Fisher College](https://fisher.osu.edu/blogs/leadreadtoday/be-a-kind-leader-rather-a-nice-leader):

>  Niceness is a social expectation wielded to help maintain order in society, to avoid conflict. It’s the polite thing to do...[N]iceness is a velvet smile applied to preserve the status quo, kindness is both a behavior and a cognitive act; it is a conscious choice to act, speak, or behave in a certain way.

Here, "kindness" is not merely agreeing during a difference of opinion or process hoping that conflict goes away. Often, being kind means
holding folks to a high standard even if they miss it or make a mistake. Your team members can meet the moment and expectations if given the
opportunity to do so. Teams who understand technical and practical issues (including the forces of life outside the project) but still ask
for high-quality work and high responsibility perform much better than those who do not face these moments.

### Definining "done"-ness

A unit of work defined as "done" indicates that it:

- Has undergone _some_ level of bug-testing and assurance of accuracy
- Provides a way to concretely assess its relative success or completeness
- Conforms to the guidelines/standards in the teams requirements documents
- Is documented (i.e., a `README` or appropriate inline commenting)

## Evaluation

The instructor will develop an evaluation rubric from team contributions and consistent with definitions from the course
[Syllabus](README.md). Should the instructor discover some lacuna or other gap in contract provisions, they will add evaluative
metrics supporting these gaps to the course evaluation tool.

This evaluation tool will be presented for an "up-down" vote during class on `22 January 2024`, at which time the contract will
be finalized. All students agree to both live up to and be evaluated by the contract and evaluative tools as a condition of their
enrollment in the course.
